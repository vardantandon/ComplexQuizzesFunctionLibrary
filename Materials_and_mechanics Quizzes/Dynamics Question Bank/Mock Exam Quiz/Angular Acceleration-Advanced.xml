over 6 seconds. Its wheels have a radius of 
30 cm. What is the average angular acceleration of the wheels?</p>
<p>(Give your answer in rads/s<sup>2</sup> to 1.d.p.</p>
<p>{1:NUMERICAL:=6.7:0.05#Good job!~*#Sorry. Try again.}</p>
<p>The car now enters a curve at a constant speed of 12 m/s. What is the radius of the curve if the acceleration felt by the passengers is 0.05g? (g is the acceleration due to gravity).</p>
<p>(Use a value of g of 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p>(Give your answer in metres to the nearest whole number</p>

<p>The car now leaves this curve and applies its brakes until it stops. Calculate the work done by the brakes.</p>

<p>{1:NUMERICAL:= 72:0.5#Good job!~*#Sorry. Try again.}</p>
<p>If the brakes locked on, instantly stopping the wheels instead of steadily slowing them, then the wheels would no longer spin and the car would skid. Assuming a skid in a straight line, what would the coefficient of friction between the tyres and the road be if the car skidded to a stop over a distance of 20 m on a flat road?</p>
