<![CDATA[<p>To solve this problem, you can use the one-dimensional equation of motion for constant acceleration systems.</p>
<p>v<sup>2</sup>=u<sup>2</sup>+2as</p>
<p>Where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration and s is the displacement.</p>
<p>In this case v=0. Also convert the initial velocity, u, from km/hr to ms<sup>-1</sup> before making calculations.</p>]]>
